## Description of BrytIsen:

#### BrytIsen is a website designed to facilitate the playing and creation of various ice-breaker games.

Many young people find it difficult to make new acquaintances, especially in new environments where they know few or none of the other participants. The target audience we are addressing, expresses that they often step out of their comfort zone to sign up for events in the hope of meeting like-minded people. To ease the atmosphere and help kick-start conversations, customers express that it would be nice to have an overview of icebreaker activities they can rely on. Therefore, we aim to create a service where users can find suggestions for such icebreaker games.

The service will provide an overview of icebreaker activities, where users can search for or post specific games and add them to a queue that can be shared with other users. It must be possible to distinguish between different types of icebreaker games based on the circumstances they are suitable for. Each icebreaker game will have its own page with a description and rules, as well as ratings and reviews given by other users. There will also be an overview of popular icebreaker games for users who do not know what they are looking for. The goal of the service is to make it easier to take the initiative to get to know new people.
